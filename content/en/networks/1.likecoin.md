### Name / Moniker
`PikaSer`  
Hong Kongers get used to calling XX Server as XX Ser  
I have a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) server named `Pika Server`(Lazy naming)  
So in short it's called `PikaSer`  

### Website
https://liker.social/@PikachuEXE

This should actually point to this website. But this website was not even started to be built when the validator service was started.

### Description
"PikachuEXE serving the network as a validator. PikaSer = Pika + Server"

### Minimum Self-Delegation
Just `1`  
This settings is not very meaningful as it can be changed anytime without limit  
Better to just look at **Self Stake Amount**  

### Commission max change rate (Cannot be changed later)
`5%` should be fine  
e.g. If current commission rate is `10%`, changing to `20%` requires at least 2 days. (`10% > 15% > 20%`)  

### Maximum Commission Rate (Cannot be changed later)
`50%`  
Never spotted `> 50%` except [Civic Liker 讚賞公民](https://bigdipper.live/likecoin/validators/likevaloper1jxpfche2386a6m0kvfpj6xq9zlrjtuqwz2rnug) and a few validators  
Also there shouldn't be anything can be done that's worth `> 50%` commission rate  

### Commission Rate
`10%`  
Let's settle "basic" stuff before looking for ways to contribute  
And decide what value to changed to afterwards  


## Reasons of Becoming a Validator on This Network

As a daily content consumer on [Matters](https://matters.news) and [Liker Social](https://liker.social/)  
Becoming a validator is a way to contribute back to the community/network  

~~I know there is commission but do you think the hosting cost can be covered with LikeCoin's price~~  
~~(I actually haven't done any calculation nor plan to sell the reward for a long time)~~  
~~Let's hope the hosting cost is not too much~~
