## Decision
`Yes`

### Explanation
It's the same as before except having 1 less member which actually makes it not easier to get enough votes within the Committee.  
Of course we can wait for 7th member but we don't have any pressing topic requiring that 7th member at the moment.  
We can change back when we find the 7th member.
