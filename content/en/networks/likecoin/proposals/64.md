## Proposal Data

### Proposal Summary

#### For creators
If you only want to register ISCN: update ISCN will spend 10x more, but it will be still neglect-able (0.018 LIKE for average fee setting)
If you want to go further create your Writing NFT: creating NFT class and minting NFT will spend 2x more, but it will be still neglect-able (0.0034 LIKE and 2.8 LIKE respectively for average fee setting)

#### For NFT collectors
Collectors will use 'Grant' module to buy NFT, so there will be no change. (0.002 LIKE for average fee setting)

#### For community:
Those modules' fee will be collected by chain (like gas), so it will goes to validator and community pool, which makes the ecosystem more robust and healthy.

## Decision
`Yes`

### Explanation
Fees paid by users are "real yield"  
An ecosystem is only healthy when there is enough real yield  
Keeping network sustainable is as important as making the network user friendly
