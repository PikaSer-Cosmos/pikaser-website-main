## Decision
`Yes`

### Explanation
Creator's Fund was created by https://www.mintscan.io/likecoin/proposals/23

[Creators Fund Status Review (Feb 2022 â€“ May 2023)
](https://blog.like.co/en/creators-fund-status-review-feb-2022-may-2023/) is available

Typo still exists in the article above when this page is written: `Total number of Civic Liker is 752 (up to 31 May 2022)`  
I think it should be `31 May 2023` (not `2022`)  

Amount & period same as https://www.mintscan.io/likecoin/proposals/60
