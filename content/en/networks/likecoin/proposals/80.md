description: 'Signalling proposal: Swap NUM to USDe of stablecoins'
---

## Proposal Data

### Proposal Summary
This proposal suggests trading 716,050 NUM tokens from our community vault (https://app.safe.global/eth:0x90ceD2202b17546D6680cfe97E3dA3bD0480b882/address-book) for USDe stablecoins to set aside funds for LikeCoin ecosystem development.  
Previously, in September 2021, we exchanged NUM and LIKE tokens (proposal #16), and since then, NUM's value has risen significantly.  
A YES vote on this proposal means supporting to swap half of the NUM tokens to USDe stablecoins.
