## Proposal Data

### Proposal Summary

One of the main reasons LikeCoin built its own blockchain in 2019 was as an alternative solution to rapidly rising Ethereum gas fees that couldn’t be resolved in the short term.
However, after several major Ethereum upgrades, particularly the Dencun upgrade that significantly reduced L2 transaction costs, the primary rationale for independently operating the LikeCoin chain no longer exists.
Therefore, I propose migrating LikeCoin to the Ethereum OP Mainnet to align with this new landscape and enhance LikeCoin’s future development.
