### Proposal Summary

Upon the passing of Proposal 85 on LikeCoin migration, Tech subdao has been in discussions with Oursky and Liker Land to list the development items and estimate the schedule and costs:

The proposal seeks community approval to allocate 69.26k USD (to be exact, 69,258.294976 USDT, currently held in the community multisig wallet) to kick off Phase 1 of the development work (120 man-days). Tech subdao has set up a 2/3 multisig wallet at eth:0x07f7355F73af2Ea47CDf0DE97863776bd833D67b for this purpose.

It is estimated that an additional 97k USD will be required for Phase 2 and 3. Tech subdao will coordinate with the developers and community in good faith to execute Phase 2 and 3. In the worst case, the migration elements will be scaled down.

## Decision
`No`

### Explanation
I don't see any satisfactory answer to my question I asked before - 'What will the software updates/economics/governance look like after migration compared to now'
